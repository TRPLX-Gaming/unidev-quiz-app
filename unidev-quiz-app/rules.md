## 📏 project rules & guidelines

1. **commitment**

   * if you voted “yes” in the polls, try not to ghost. small consistent effort > disappearing for weeks.

2. **code quality**

   * keep code **simple and readable**.
   * if you vibe code (ai-generated snippets), make sure to:

     * read and understand what it does.
     * remove unnecessary comments/boilerplate.
     * rewrite parts in your own style where possible.

3. **collaboration**

   * don’t hog a role; if frontend is overcrowded, be ready to flex into content or docs.
   * ask questions openly in the group—no shame in being a beginner.

4. **git etiquette**

   * use clear commit messages (e.g. `feat: add quiz card ui`).
   * don’t push broken code to `main`.
   * if unsure, open a pull request and ask for review.

5. **communication**

   * we’ll have weekly check-ins. update your team lead on progress/roadblocks.
   * keep group chat focused (tech + project). off-topic stuff = fine but don’t flood.

6. **respect**

   * no gatekeeping, no toxic vibes. remember: this is a learning project.

7. **decisions**

   * big choices (tech stack, features, deadlines) are made by **poll** → majority vote wins.
